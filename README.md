## The BTP Police Service are looking to understand how their stop and search policies have changed over time

**The latest data is available through the public [Police Data API](https://data.police.uk/docs/method/stops-force/)**

Your task is to complete following steps

- Write a script in Python to programmatically pull down all stop and search data from the API for the BTP Police Service
- Combine all data into a Pandas dataframe
- Clean and format the data as you see appropriate
- Write the data out to a csv file
- Write a process that checks to see if new data has been added to the API at a given time each day if so it should pull the new data and join it to the existing csv file
- Prepare a short explanation of how you would store the data in a relational database if required think about the structure of the data and what schema you would apply
- Suppose entries were updated or deleted in the API how would your propose that your system should handle this?
- Prepare an example of how you would create a view on the database to return an aggregate count of the number of each crime type by date
- If there are other technologies that you want to include in your solution, do feel free donâ€™t feel constrained by the brief This is your chance to show off all your data engineering skills!
